You will need boost. I'm not sure how far back will be fine, 1_54? I'm using 1_61.
The environment variable BOOST_ROOT is just about as standard as I've seen.
If you are already using it all should be good with the headers.
I also have the variable BOOST_LIB on my system. What I will do is include the
libs I'm using in this package. (A TODO). But this will have to be dealt with.

So if you don't set a BOOST_LIB environment variable, or use another path,
in the gear project->properties
Linker->General->Additional Library Directories, replace it with your boost lib path.

there are two dll/library projects that have to be built the xml.dll and dxf.lib

the xml project is set up to build the hexml_10d.dll. cd/open to: project\xml\xml.sln" and build
	it should place files where needed, you should not have to do anything else
	
the dxf library is set to build dxfd.lib. cd/open to: project\dxflib\dxflib-3.7.5-src\dfxlib_vc\dfxlib_vc.sln and build
	it should place files where needed, you should not have to do anything else

You can close those solutions and probably will not need them again for a while/until you need builds for Release/updates.

Now the gears project should build. If I've missed something, please let me know: zero at lakeweb dot net
Thanks, Dan.
